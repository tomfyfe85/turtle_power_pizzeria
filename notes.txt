Kay's notes:

More classes:
each class has a single responsibility:

order.py
Order class can be be the God class;
import all classes into Order.
export add_to_basket and view_basket out and
create a new basket class.
(Order could be renamed restaurant?)

menu.py
should just have the menu,
create and add function to add items to the menu

#to create
formatter , 
a class that any class can use to handle formatting
of it's return data
use __repr__ method?

basket
basket functionality from the order class

phone_number_validator
confirms a valid uk phone number
